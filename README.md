# NumberGuesser
This is a small project build using Js, for style I used Skeleton Css.
Number Guesser Game functions are:

1)Player must guess a number between a min and a max
2)Player gets a certain amount of guesses
3)Player will be notified of guesses remaining
4)Player will be notified of the correct answer if loose
5)Player can choose to play again
